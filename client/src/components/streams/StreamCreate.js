// NOTES

/* Reason we are going to make a class based component, is because we are eventually going to have a bunch of helper methods to better organize our code */

/* Anytime the field tag calls the component or function inside the property with a key of component, itâ€™s going to pass in some number of arguments. Including any errors from our validate function */
